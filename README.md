HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it represents the content and structure of a web page.

In this workshop, you will learn how to work with basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will learn how to work with basic HTML
elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists by building a
cat photo app.

        The first element you will learn about is the h1 element.
        The h1 element is a heading element and is used for the main
        heading of a webpage.

        Example Code
        <h1>This is a main heading</h1>
        Add an h1 element with the text of CatPhotoApp and watch the
        change in the browser preview.

        When you are done, press the "Check Your Code" button to see
        if it's correct.

Step 2
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify
the importance of content below them. The lower the number,
the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less
importance than h1 elements.

          Example Code
          <h1>most important heading element</h1>
          <h2>second most important heading element</h2>
          <h3>third most important heading element</h3>
          <h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
          <h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
          <h6>least important heading element</h6>
          Only use one h1 element per page and place lower-importance
          headings below higher-importance headings.

          Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text:

          Cat Photos

Step 3
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.
Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following
text:

          Everyone loves cute cats online!


Step 4
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser
display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML
starts with, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with.

          Here is an example of a comment with the TODO: Remove h1:

          Example Code
          TODO: Remove h1
          Add a comment above the p element with this text:

          TODO: Add link to cat photos

Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas.
These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

          The main element is used to represent the main content of the body
          of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique
          to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

          Example Code
          <main>
            <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
            <p>Some more important content...</p>
          </main>
          Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before
          the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.


Step 6
In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

Here is an example of nesting and indentation:

Example Code

<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
The h1 element, h2 element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the main element in the code below. Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the p element so that it is indented properly as well.
